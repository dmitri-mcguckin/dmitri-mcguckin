### Hey, I'm Dmitri 👋

🚀 I love all things aerospace.

💼 I'm currently looking for work. Would love most: any opportunities to work with satellites.

🛰️ You can find most of my work over at the [OreSat Project](https://github.com/oresat).

📡 I primarily create software things for OreSat's [UniClOGS](https://github.com/oresat/uniclogs-software) in anticipation for [Oresat0](https://www.oresat.org/satellites/oresat-0) and [Oresat1](https://www.oresat.org/satellites/oresat). (Read more about what UniClOGS is: [here](https://www.oresat.org/technologies/ground-stations#h.xwp9u3881b6t))
