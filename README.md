### Hey, I'm Dmitri 👋

🚀 I love all things aerospace.

📡 During the day, I work at Raytheon, making ground-station software.

🛰️ Durring the night I work on [@oresat](https://github.com/oresat), [@psas](https://github.com/psas), and [@uniclogs](https://github.com/uniclogs) a student-led satellite & rocket team out of Portland OR. *(Much of what I do for them is open-source and open-hardware, too!)*
