### Hey, I'm Dmitri 👋

🚀 I love all things aerospace.

💼 I'm currently looking for work. Would love most: any opportunities to work with satellites.

🛰️ You can find most of my work over at [@oresat](https://github.com/oresat) and [@psas](https://github.com/psas).

📡 Lately I've been creating software things for [@oresat](https://github.com/oresat)'s [UniClOGS](https://github.com/oresat/uniclogs-software) groundstation in anticipation for [Oresat0](https://www.oresat.org/satellites/oresat-0) and [Oresat1](https://www.oresat.org/satellites/oresat). (Read more about UniClOGS [here](https://www.oresat.org/technologies/ground-stations#h.xwp9u3881b6t))
