📡 During the day, I work for [CesumAstro](https://www.cesiumastro.com/), making satellites and ground-stations.

🛰️ Durring the night I work on [@oresat](https://github.com/oresat) and [@psas](https://github.com/psas), a student-led satellite & rocket team out of Portland OR. *(Much of what I do for them is open-source and open-hardware, too!)*
